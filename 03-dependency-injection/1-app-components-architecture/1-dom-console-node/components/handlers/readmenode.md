module is exported. 

a function is added.

let variable is declared. process.argv.slice 2 means that:
So a slice starting at 2 will discard both of those and 
return everything else that was typed on the command line. 
These are the arguments that will be used to construct the API query string.
(from teamtree). 

let variable a equals to number arg 0: let variable b equals to # args 1.
This is because:

The first item (argv[0]) will be the path to node itself, 
and the second item (argv[1]) will be the path to your script code.

if function is NaN which determines if value is NaN or not. 
for a and b. if NaN is not a value, a equals false. Same for b. 

this is connected to a controller and an add function. variables a and b.
